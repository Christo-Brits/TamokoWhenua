      <h1>How Tamoko Whenua Partners with Councils & Iwi for Regional Growth</h1>
      <p><em>By Tamoko Whenua Collective | May 17, 2025</em></p>
      <p>
        Regional growth in Northland depends on strong partnerships between councils, iwi, and community-focused contractors. At Tamoko Whenua, we bring together local knowledge, cultural competency, and technical expertise to deliver projects that benefit everyone. Our partnership model ensures that every civil construction project uplifts whānau, supports Māori trades training, and leaves a positive legacy.

        We’ve worked on <a href="/subdivisions">subdivisions</a>, <a href="/drainage">drainage</a>, and community infrastructure across the region. Our collaborative approach with councils and iwi helps us deliver outcomes that reflect the aspirations of Northland communities. Learn more about our kaupapa and team on the <a href="/about-us">About Us</a> page, or <a href="/partner-with-us">partner with us</a> to start your own project.
