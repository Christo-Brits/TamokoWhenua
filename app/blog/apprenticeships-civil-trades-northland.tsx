        At Tamoko Whenua, we believe the future of civil construction in Northland belongs to our rangatahi. Our apprenticeship and workforce development programmes open doors for Māori youth to gain hands-on experience, industry credentials, and a pathway to meaningful careers.

        One recent apprentice, Hemi, started on a <a href="/footpath-construction">footpath construction</a> crew in <a href="/areas-we-serve/kaipara-district">Kaipara District</a> and is now leading his own team. Stories like Hemi’s show how investing in local talent builds stronger communities and a skilled workforce for the region.
